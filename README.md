# BananaRun
A simple demo I made to learn the basics of Unity3D. Just a banana that runs around, shoots bullets that do nothing and coins that make a cool sound when you collide with them. 

Also included the spritesheet that was made with [PyxelEdit](https://pyxeledit.com/)

# Controls
WASD/Arrow keys to move the banana.

Left click to shoot, right click to attrack the coins.
